UEFA Champions League 2024/25 Fixture Optimization:

This project implements an Artificial Intelligence model to optimize the fixture scheduling for the UEFA Champions League 2024/25 season. By leveraging simulated annealing techniques, our solution significantly reduces travel distances for participating teams.


AI-Driven Optimization: Utilizes simulated annealing to generate efficient fixture schedules,
Substantial Travel Reduction: Achieves a remarkable 5000km decrease in travel distances per iteration,
UEFA Champions League Focus: Specifically tailored for the 2024/25 season format.

Purpose:
The primary goal of this project is to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of the Champions League by minimizing travel requirements. This optimization not only reduces the carbon footprint associated with the tournament but also potentially improves player welfare by reducing travel fatigue.
